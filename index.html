I am capable of a deep violence
Precise and purple, steeped in shallow oceans
Diamond crust obscures the granules, blood wet between the toes
I am capable of a great hurt
Drawn wound, strung across the shores of you and me
An insect suspended in the air, hymning
‘Praise be to longevity’ and so on and so on
The temperament of kicked furniture could measure not it

I am not here, I leave
Prayers at the foundations of a tempestuous plant
Your clothes folded and stowed every morning, as if by magic
Your home in me, leave me, hollow me
Deciduous lanterns hung by the grave
Plantasia, fantasia

I am capable of naming dreams
I need not you
You need not me
I am capable of bypassing stopped vehicles
On my own, in my own right, impasse

Impressed by a diluted shiver of what I called ‘Light’
The voidance invited me, deluded
‘I am capable of knowing you’ and I said back
‘So be it’

I live in a city of crumbs
Drawn into an enclosed space, continuously
By a saw-toothed tube, and shaken out
No matches for the Age of the Internet

Cuisine of gelled perishability
Drawn on one screen
On thousands
Shaken out, spit on
The great blue cauldron stirs itself, sloshes you

I sit on perfect cut-outs of people’s faces which
Pink with poverty, ameliorated their little local business
With a handful of scrap paper, a cell[phone] number at each tear
And a personal & personalized enclosed space, for each do-gooder

(Revisited by the archival machine, I lose my stubborn character again
Page by page)

The pot beckoned me closer, gnashed its barbed mouth
‘I’ll chew you up, or who will?’
Then I looked up, and everyone was here again
Then I looked up, and I was home again

I kneel and worship square doors
Safe in a locked arm, gasping tenderly
A cavity stumbles, makes a dying noise, lies parallel to the tongue
I lay too by its forlorn side

I feel something leave from the open roof of my mouth, struck a white wire 
Fell stone stiff to the buzzing street below

Resistant to the crushing force, I breathe again in iron lungs
A trauma, screen-printed on black canvas bags
Not mine, no body of mine could be found
Not teeth, nor eye, nor heel

Then I heard something a-wake and a-flutter
In the cupped palms of Mary’s two hands
One barbed, the other soft like a newly thrown vase
